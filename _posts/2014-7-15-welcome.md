Welcome back to another year at Georgia Tech! Hopefully you're settled in with the courseload and ready to get back into the saddle with IEEE.

We've got some exciting plans for this upcoming year, so be sure to sign up for the [newsletter](http://gt-ieee.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a42ec30139b77172f44401aa5&id=a4ddfb6da0)! Also like us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gtieee?fref=photo) so you don't miss out on any IEEE goodness.

We'll be kicking off the year with tech talks, resume workshops, new projects from IEEE [Innovation](/innovation.html) and [Hardware](/hardware.html) teams, online profiles for all you lovely members that are always dedicated to IEEE, and of course, ECE [tutoring](/tutoring.html) services again as the year begins.

Please don't forget to pay your annual dues!
