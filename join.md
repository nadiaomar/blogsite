#Benefits of Being a Member of IEEE

__Company Presentations__ - We have corporate presentations nearly every week. Technical companies send representatives to our meetings to talk about the projects they work on. Often times the representatives will stick around after the meeting to answer questions and take resumes.

__Faculty Presentations__ - We bring in faculty members from Georgia Tech to talk about their research.This presents a great opportunity to make contact with the professors and get involved in faculty research projects.

__Leadership, School Involvement, and Networking__ - Elections are held every year in March and everyone is encouraged to run for a position. We are always looking for additional help with the events we plan, so there are many opportunities to get involved whether or not you are an officer.

__Competitions and Regional Events__ - IEEE is involved in a number of different regional competitions, scholarships, and events. Our student members are welcome to participate in any of these events.

__Social Activities__ - Every semester we try to plan a few not-so-technical events, such as paintball outings, barbequeues, and movie nights.

__Technical Periodicals__ - Your IEEE Student Membership comes with subscriptions to Spectrum, an award-winning technical magazine, Potentials, which is published by students, and The Institute, an excellent monthly newsletter.

__Membership in a Professional Society__ - You get the satisfaction and prestige of being involved with the largest IEEE Student Branch in the United States!
Joining as a student member is much cheaper than joining as a regular member. In addition, student members receive the same benefits as regular members. Even after graduation, a students dues are significantly reduced for five years.

<p class="lead">Companies are beating down our door trying to find students who are well-rounded. Students who are actively involved in IEEE are prime candidates and have a good opportunity to meet recruiters who work with and sponsor IEEE activities. </p>
